# Google Calendar Widget [![Build Status](http://devtools1.risevision.com:8080/view/Widgets%20and%20Components/job/Widget-Google-Calendar-Master-Build/badge/icon)](http://devtools1.risevision.com:8080/view/Widgets%20and%20Components/job/Widget-Google-Calendar-Master-Build/)

## Introduction

The Google Calendar Widget allows users to show a public Google calendar in a Presentation.

Google Calendar Widget works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) and [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) for testing

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the Widget, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

The Widget can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-google-calendar.git
cd widget-google-calendar
npm install
bower install
gulp build
```

The source code for the Widget can be found in the `src` folder. This is where you will want to make your custom changes.

### Run Locally
To preview Widgets locally, you'll need to use the [Widget Preview](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-preview) app available [here](http://192.254.220.36/~rvi/widget-preview/).

### Testing
Execute the following command in Terminal to run both end-to-end and unit tests:
```
gulp test
```

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, run `gulp build` again, which will regenerate the `dist` folder. The `dist` folder contains all of the files that need to be deployed to your server. In the Rise Vision Platform, you can then add your custom Widget via the *Gadgets* tab. Give your Widget a name, select a *Type* of *Widget*, paste the link to the `widget.html` file in the *URL* field, and the link to the `settings.html` file in the *Custom UI URL* field:
