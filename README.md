## Introduction

The Google Calendar Widget allows users to show a public Google calendar in a Presentation.

Widget Google Calendar works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
- NPM (node package manager)
- Angularjs
- Gulp
- Bower
- Karma and Mocha for testing

## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
The Widget can be installed by executing the following commands:
```
git clone git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-google-calendar.git
cd widget-google-calendar
npm install
bower install
gulp build
```

### Run Local
To preview Widgets locally, you'll have to run the [Widget Preview](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-preview) app available for download [here](http://192.254.220.36/~rvi/widget-preview/).

### Dependencies
* **Gulp** - is used as a task runner. It lints, runs unit tests and E2E (end to end) tests, minimizes files, etc.  all dependencies for this is in the gulp.js file.
* **Bower** - is used as a package manager for javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party javascript frameworks and libraries are listed as dependencies in the bower.json file.
* **NPM & Nodejs** - the node package manager is used in hand in hand with gulp to start a server to host the app and all the dependencies needed from using a node server. All these node dependencies are listed in the package.json file

### Testing
To run unit and E2E testing, do
```bash
gulp test
```
